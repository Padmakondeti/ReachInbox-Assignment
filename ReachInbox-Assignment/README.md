# ReachInbox Assignment

## Server

The assignment is to build a tool that will check and parse the emails in  multiple IMAP email accounts (like a Google and Outlook email ID) to access and manage several different email accounts from a single email client or application across various devices, and
respond to the e-mails based on the context using AI. Use BullMQ as the tasks scheduler
This is a server-based application built with Node.js and Express. It uses various packages such as  `openai` for AI functionalities, `googleapis` for Google APIs, and `axios` for HTTP requests and `bullMQ` to process queues.

## Overview

### 1. Node

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows for the execution of JavaScript code server-side.

### 2. Express

Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features.

### 3. React

React is a JavaScript library for building Ssamless UI. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and organize UI elements, promoting reusability and maintainability.React Provide SOC ( Seperation of Concerns ) so we can separate our app.

### 4. Axios
